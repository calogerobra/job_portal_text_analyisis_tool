# A tool for a dictionary-based textual analysis of job portal data.

This project provides a toolkit to conduct textual analysis of skills content on job descriptions in job portal data. The tool is dictionary-based, i.e., it searches for pre-defined key words and regular expressions upon normalizing the text. All input files are in Excel format to facilitate usage also for non-programmers.
The tool is part of a WorlBank policy analysis on how to use job platform data to assess skills demand in development contexts.
